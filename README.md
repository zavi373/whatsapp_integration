This n8n workflow:

Listens for WhatsApp messages (via a trigger).

Passes the received message to an AI agent (powered by Google Gemini).

The AI generates a response.

The workflow sends the AI’s reply back to the user on WhatsApp.

So it’s basically a WhatsApp chatbot powered by Google Gemini AI, built in n8n
